    Introduction:
        This goal is the first homework of my coding bootcamp assignment. The goal is to practice a "ticket job" where I was given an existing index.html and style.css file. My goals were to increase the accessibility, contain semantic html elements, ensure the elements follow a logical structure, add alt attributes to the image elements, the headings elements fall in sequential order, and update the title.
